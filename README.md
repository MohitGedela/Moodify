This web application lets users snap a photo or upload an image, then analyzes the detected facial expression to determine their current emotion. Behind the scenes, it leverages a deep‑learning emotion detection model to classify joy, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. Once an emotion is identified, the app automatically generates a Spotify playlist perfectly tailored to that mood seamlessly integrating with the Spotify API to fetch tracks that uplift, soothe, or energize. Built with Streamlit for a lightweight, browser‑based UI and Spotipy for playlist control, this tool offers a fun, hands‑on way to discover music that matches how you feel.
